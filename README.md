- 👋 Hi, I’m @DevonLee8
- 👀 I’m interested in learning databases and analytics; As of now, coding to me is a tool for me to explore data and extract insights - later, I hope to explore Machine Learning
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python and looking build a portfolio for SQL and Python
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on database and analytics projects

I have recently began learning SQL and Python and am in the process of building personal projects to showcase my capabilities. Currently, I have an Excel dashboard that utilizes Pivot Tables and Macros. 

I am interested in learning about how you began your journey in coding and what you do with your coding skillset, both professionally and personally!

Nice to meet you! Hopefully we can connect!
