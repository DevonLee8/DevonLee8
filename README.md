- 👋 Hi, I’m @DevonLee8
- 👀 I’m interested in learning databases and analytics; As of now, coding to me is a tool for me work with the system and retrieve information - later, I hope to get into Machine Learning
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python and looking build a portfolio for SQL and Python
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on database and analytics projects

I have recently began learning SQL and Python and am still in the early stages of a beginner. Neither do I have a background is CS but I am interested in finding ways to learn about information systems and how they communicate with one another. 

I am interested in learning about how you began your journey in coding and what you do with your coding skillset, both professionally and personally!

Nice to meet you! Hopefully we can connect!
